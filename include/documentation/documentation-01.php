<p class="raleway trescientos m-large grey-text md-panel-box-down-margin">Get familiar with the basic setup and overview of Caro.</p>
<p class="raleway trescientos small">The simplest way to use a visualization created in <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span> on an external site is as follows. If you already have maps on your webpage and want to add <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span> visualizations to them, read Adding <span class="carto-green"><span class="carto-green">CARTO</span></span> layers to an existing map.</p>

<p class="raleway trescientos m-large grey-text md-panel-box-down-margin">Using the <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span>.js LibraryPermalink</p>
<p class="raleway trescientos small"><span class="carto-green">CARTO</span>.js can be used to embed a visualization you have designed using <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span>â€™s user interface, or to dynamically create visualizations from scratch, using your data. If you want to create new maps on your webpage, jump to Creating a visualization from scratch. If you already have maps on your webpage and want to add <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span> visualizations to them, read Adding <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span> layers to an existing map.</p>
<p class="raleway trescientos small">You can also use the <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span> APIs to create visualizations programmatically. This can be useful when the visualizations react to user interactions. To read more about it, jump to Creating visualizations at runtime.</p>


<p class="raleway trescientos m-large grey-text md-panel-box-down-margin">Other Mapping Libraries</p>
<p class="raleway trescientos small">We have also made it easy for you to build maps using the mapping library of your choice. Whether you are using Leaflet or something else, our <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span>.js code remains the same. This makes our API documentation simple and straightforward. It also makes it easy for you to consistently develop, or maintain, multiple maps online.</p>

<p class="raleway trescientos m-large grey-text md-panel-box-down-margin">Creating a Visualization from ScratchPermalink</p>
<p class="raleway trescientos small">This is the easiest way to quickly get a <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span> map onto your webpage. Use this method when there is no map in your application, and you want to add the visualization to hack over it. <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span>.js handles all the details of loading a map interface, basemap, and your <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span> visualization.</p>
<p class="raleway trescientos small">You can start by giving <span class="carto-green">CARTO</span>.js the DIV ID from your HTML where you want to place your map, and the viz.json URL of your visualization (which you can get from the Publish your map options).</p><br />
